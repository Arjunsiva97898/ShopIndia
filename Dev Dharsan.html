    <p>We’ve all heard the narrative. Carbs are bad. Carbs will raise your blood sugar and lead to an energy crash later. Carbs should be avoided at all costs.


        But the truth is, carbs are hard to avoid—and not just because many delicious foods are full of them. Aiming for perfect self-control with carbs simply isn’t a realistic goal. And our bodies do need some carbs to function.
        
        
        So how do we strike a healthy carb balance? Is it a lost cause?
        
        
        With Unicity Balance, it doesn’t have to be.</p>
